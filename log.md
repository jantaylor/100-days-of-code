# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No progress on Wikipedia Viewer.

**Thoughts:** I have spent hours on trying to get $.getJSON and $.ajax to work and I've been unable to. Not sure how much more I can take before I move on to another project. Exported my codepen and created a github repo for it.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer](http://codepen.io/janttaylor/full/LRQVKm/)
