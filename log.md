# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No progress on Wikipedia Viewer.

**Thoughts:** I have spent hours on trying to get $.getJSON and $.ajax to work and I've been unable to. Not sure how much more I can take before I move on to another project. Exported my codepen and created a github repo for it.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a better description and more projects to my portfolio

**Thoughts:** I first did my portfolio fast, but now I can take my time and improve wording and update it with more projects. I added 3 more projects from FreeCodeCamp and improved some HTML.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried rebuilding the ajax and using getjson again.

**Thoughts:** Was unable to get it to work. I tried making my code as similar to known working codepen but still couldn't get it to work. Might just have to move on.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building html structure of the Twitch JSON API project

**Thoughts:** Used PUG again, had a good experience starting the html structure. There's more to do, but I'll have something to do for a couple of days.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the Wikipedia Viewer FCC Project

**Thoughts:** Thanks to @JBoykinMusic I was able to figure out why I was not able to complete a GET request. I turns out I didn't have my form set up correctly and fixing that and moving to a submit button made all the difference.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added javascript for http request and read about twitch API

**Thoughts:** I started working on the javascript for the twitch json API FCC project. I have the html fleshed out, now I just need to keep working on the javascript. Which is good because I would say it's my weakness right now.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added correct jquery getJSON for twitch API

**Thoughts:** I guess I was misreading the instructions and started to implement how to get the json object without jquery. Which isn't as easy in my opinion. ajax and getJSON are great!

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated other functions to work and correctly display links and pictures

**Thoughts:** I had forgotten to take out a bad piece of code. It prevented the getJSON to finish before moving onto the online check, but removing that and they all worked. I also read up on the twitch API more.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Twitch.tv JSON API FCC Project

**Thoughts:** Finished coding the twitch.tv json API FCC project. I'm baffled at how much easier that project was than the wikipedia project. I spent hours on that, and only a couple of hours over days on the twitch project. Now I'll be working on advanced projects for my challenge.

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started designing the Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts:** Worked in between breaks and lunch to read about the pomodoro clock and started on that. It will be quite the challenge so far without taking the advanced algorithm scripting courses.

### Day 11: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started learning bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Started learning bootstrap by rebuilding my company's website. I thought it would be easy to remake and I could do some really cool effects on it. I know how to do everythign in materialize, but not in bootstrap.

### Day 12: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed header padding & links, created next two sections

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is a different type of framework. I find myself using the classes from materialize, but they don't work. I have to google bootstraps classes to get the results I want. Not necessarily a bad thing, I'm learning and it is the most used css framework for a reason.

### Day 13: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added additional sections, padding, and footer

**Thoughts:** The original site has the containers squished. I need to learn how to do that and then figure out why my carousel images are not full width. CSS might be able to fix that.

### Day 14: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added alternating gray bgs and different types of CSS for the sliders.

**Thoughts:** I still can't figure out why the container-fluid class isn't going full width like the documentation says it should. I googled and found some CSS code that should fix it with margins, but that did not help "stretch" it.

### Day 15: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed sliders to CSS backgrounds and updated margins

**Thoughts:** I had to cheat a bit. I didn't quite know how the original site had their images, but I learned that you can set images as backgrounds in CSS and do all sorts of manipulation on them. I then saw on the same CSS from chrome that margins are pushed in which is what is causing the text to be smashed in and easier to read so I implemented that. Getting closer...
