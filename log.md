# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No progress on Wikipedia Viewer.

**Thoughts:** I have spent hours on trying to get $.getJSON and $.ajax to work and I've been unable to. Not sure how much more I can take before I move on to another project. Exported my codepen and created a github repo for it.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a better description and more projects to my portfolio

**Thoughts:** I first did my portfolio fast, but now I can take my time and improve wording and update it with more projects. I added 3 more projects from FreeCodeCamp and improved some HTML.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried rebuilding the ajax and using getjson again.

**Thoughts:** Was unable to get it to work. I tried making my code as similar to known working codepen but still couldn't get it to work. Might just have to move on.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building html structure of the Twitch JSON API project

**Thoughts:** Used PUG again, had a good experience starting the html structure. There's more to do, but I'll have something to do for a couple of days.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the Wikipedia Viewer FCC Project

**Thoughts:** Thanks to @JBoykinMusic I was able to figure out why I was not able to complete a GET request. I turns out I didn't have my form set up correctly and fixing that and moving to a submit button made all the difference.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added javascript for http request and read about twitch API

**Thoughts:** I started working on the javascript for the twitch json API FCC project. I have the html fleshed out, now I just need to keep working on the javascript. Which is good because I would say it's my weakness right now.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added correct jquery getJSON for twitch API

**Thoughts:** I guess I was misreading the instructions and started to implement how to get the json object without jquery. Which isn't as easy in my opinion. ajax and getJSON are great!
