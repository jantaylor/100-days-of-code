# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No progress on Wikipedia Viewer.

**Thoughts:** I have spent hours on trying to get $.getJSON and $.ajax to work and I've been unable to. Not sure how much more I can take before I move on to another project. Exported my codepen and created a github repo for it.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a better description and more projects to my portfolio

**Thoughts:** I first did my portfolio fast, but now I can take my time and improve wording and update it with more projects. I added 3 more projects from FreeCodeCamp and improved some HTML.
